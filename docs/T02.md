# Task ID: T02
# Title: Form Wizard Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: T01 (pending)

Implement the core multi-step/wizard UI that will host all data-collection forms, with state management and navigation logic.

## Detailed Description

Create a robust, reusable wizard framework that will guide users through the complex process of creating energy offers. The wizard must handle navigation between steps, validate data before progression, and maintain state across all form sections.

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- **Zustand** store for wizard state management
- Persist state to localStorage for draft recovery
- Type-safe store with TypeScript interfaces
- Separate slices for each form section

### Wizard Architecture
```typescript
interface WizardState {
  currentStep: number
  completedSteps: Set<number>
  formData: OfferFormData
  validationErrors: ValidationErrors
  isDirty: boolean
}
```

### Navigation Features
- Step-by-step navigation with progress indicator
- Ability to jump to previously completed steps
- Conditional step visibility based on form data
- Prevent navigation with unsaved changes

### UI Components
- **Progress bar** showing completion status
- **Step indicator** with numbered circles
- **Navigation buttons** (Previous, Next, Save Draft)
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for quick access
- **Side navigation** panel with all sections

### Form Integration
- **react-hook-form** integration for each step
- **Zod** schemas for validation
- Shared form context across steps
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly accordion layout on small screens
- Desktop multi-column layout with sidebar
- Touch-friendly navigation controls
- Keyboard navigation support

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load form sections
- Memoize validation functions
- Virtual scrolling for long forms
- Code splitting by wizard step

## Key Requirements
- Support for ~18 different form sections
- Handle conditional visibility rules
- Maintain form state across browser sessions
- Provide clear visual feedback on progress

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wizard navigation component implemented
- [ ] Zustand store configured with TypeScript
- [ ] Progress tracking functionality
- [ ] Form state persistence to localStorage
- [ ] Responsive layout for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
