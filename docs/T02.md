# Task ID: T02

# Title: Form Wizard Framework

# Status: completed

# Dependencies: T01 (pending)

Implement the core multi-step/wizard UI that will host all data-collection forms, with state management and navigation logic.

## Detailed Description

Create a robust, reusable wizard framework that will guide users through the complex process of creating energy offers. The wizard must handle navigation between steps, validate data before progression, and maintain state across all form sections.

## Technical Considerations

### State Management

- **Zustand** store for wizard state management
- Persist state to localStorage for draft recovery
- Type-safe store with TypeScript interfaces
- Separate slices for each form section

### Wizard Architecture

```typescript
interface WizardState {
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: Set<number>;
  formData: OfferFormData;
  validationErrors: ValidationErrors;
  isDirty: boolean;
}
```

### Navigation Features

- Step-by-step navigation with progress indicator
- Ability to jump to previously completed steps
- Conditional step visibility based on form data
- Prevent navigation with unsaved changes

### UI Components

- **Progress bar** showing completion status
- **Step indicator** with numbered circles
- **Navigation buttons** (Previous, Next, Save Draft)
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for quick access
- **Side navigation** panel with all sections

### Form Integration

- **react-hook-form** integration for each step
- **Zod** schemas for validation
- Shared form context across steps
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-friendly accordion layout on small screens
- Desktop multi-column layout with sidebar
- Touch-friendly navigation controls
- Keyboard navigation support

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy load form sections
- Memoize validation functions
- Virtual scrolling for long forms
- Code splitting by wizard step

## Key Requirements

- Support for ~18 different form sections
- Handle conditional visibility rules
- Maintain form state across browser sessions
- Provide clear visual feedback on progress

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Wizard navigation component implemented
- [x] Zustand store configured with TypeScript
- [x] Progress tracking functionality
- [x] Form state persistence to localStorage
- [x] Responsive layout for mobile/desktop
- [x] Keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Notes

### Completed on: June 13, 2025

The wizard framework has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **Wizard Container** (`components/wizard/wizard-container.tsx`):
   - Main orchestrator for the multi-step form
   - Handles step navigation and form state management
   - Auto-save functionality with 5-second debounce
   - Form data persistence across page reloads

2. **State Management** (`store/wizard-store.ts`):
   - Zustand store with TypeScript support
   - LocalStorage persistence using zustand/middleware
   - Tracks current step, completed steps, and form data
   - Handles validation errors and dirty state

3. **Navigation Components**:
   - Bottom navigation with Previous/Next buttons
   - Step counter in header
   - Keyboard navigation support (Alt + ←/→, Ctrl/Cmd + S)
   - Prevents navigation to incomplete steps

4. **Form Integration**:
   - React Hook Form for form management
   - Real-time synchronization between forms and store
   - Automatic form restoration on page reload
   - Support for nested form data structures

5. **UI Features**:
   - Clean, minimalist design without sidebar
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
   - Auto-save indicator when data is dirty
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

Note: The original design included a sidebar navigation which was removed per user request. The current implementation uses a simpler header-based step indicator.
