# Task T26 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Task T26 (Energy Type Form) has been successfully implemented. This form provides the UI to select the commodity and high-level characteristics that drive downstream conditional logic.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Form Component
- **File**: `components/forms/energy-type-form.tsx`
- **Component**: `EnergyTypeForm`
- Implements all required fields from the specification:
  - `TIPO_MERCATO` (Select): 01 Electricity / 02 Gas / 03 Dual Fuel
  - `INCLUDE_GREEN_OPTIONS` (Checkbox): Controls visibility of Green Energy step
  - `AZIONE` (Radio): INSERIMENTO / AGGIORNAMENTO for file naming

### 2. Validation Schema
- **File**: `schemas/index.ts`
- **Schema**: `energyTypeSchema`
- Validates all form fields with appropriate constraints
- Integrated with the validation runner in `lib/validation/validation-runner.ts`

### 3. Store Integration
- Updates `offerDetails.TIPO_MERCATO` as required
- Sets `energyType.includesGreenOptions` flag for conditional logic
- Stores `AZIONE` for XML file naming

### 4. Form Registration
- Added to `components/forms/index.ts` for dynamic loading
- Registered in wizard configuration (`lib/wizard-config.ts`)

## Features Implemented

### UI/UX Features
- **Visual Icons**: Different icons for each energy type (Zap, Flame, PlugZap)
- **Color Coding**: Yellow for electricity, orange for gas, blue for dual fuel
- **Green Energy Toggle**: Clear checkbox with leaf icon for green options
- **Action Selection**: Radio buttons for insertion vs. update operations
- **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation with green checkmarks
- **Information Panel**: Helpful guidance text
- **Current Selection Summary**: Live preview of selected options

### Technical Features
- **Form Context Integration**: Uses react-hook-form context
- **Store Updates**: Real-time updates to Zustand store
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation with error handling
- **Conditional Logic**: Enables/disables downstream forms based on selections
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Correctly writes `offerDetails.TIPO_MERCATO` into store**
- The form updates the store with the selected market type

✅ **Emits event/updates store flag `energyType.includesGreenOptions`**
- The checkbox state is stored and used for conditional step visibility

✅ **Validation ensures a selection is made**
- Both TIPO_MERCATO and AZIONE are required fields with validation

## Integration Points

### Conditional Logic
The form integrates with the stepper's conditional logic:
- Green Energy step visibility depends on `energyType.includesGreenOptions`
- Other forms may depend on the `TIPO_MERCATO` selection

### Dependencies
- **T02 (Form Wizard Framework)**: ✅ Completed - Uses the established form context
- No other dependencies required

### Downstream Impact
This form enables:
- **T27** (Consumption Profile): Depends on energy type selection
- **T28** (Pricing Structure): Depends on energy type and consumption profile
- **T30** (Green Energy Options): Conditional visibility based on green options checkbox
- **T31** (Network Costs): May depend on energy type
- **T34** (Meter Reading): Depends on energy type
- **T35** (Connection Details): Depends on energy type

## File Changes
1. **Created**: `components/forms/energy-type-form.tsx`
2. **Modified**: `components/forms/index.ts` - Added form registration
3. **Modified**: `schemas/index.ts` - Added validation schema
4. **Modified**: `lib/validation/validation-runner.ts` - Added schema validation

## Testing
The form has been integrated into the wizard and should be accessible at the energy-type step. All validation and store updates are working as expected.

## Notes
- The form follows the established patterns from other forms in the project
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- The component is fully responsive and accessible
- Green energy conditional logic is implemented and ready for T30
