# Task File Generation Guidelines

> Activation: Apply these guidelines whenever generating or updating plain-text task files in the workspace.

## 1. File Formatting

✅ **DO** use a consistent, human-readable layout for every task file.

* Start each line with a `#` followed by the property label and its value.
* Separate logical sections (e.g., metadata vs. description) with a blank line.
* Keep line endings UNIX-style (`\n`).

## 2. Required Properties

Each task file **must** include the following properties in this exact order:

1. `Task ID`  – unique identifier for the task
2. `Title`    – concise, descriptive summary
3. `Status`   – one of `pending`, `in-progress`, or `done`
4. `Dependencies` – comma-separated list or `None`

Example header (values are illustrative):
```
# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement login flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17 (done), 25 (pending)
```

## 3. Dependency Formatting

When listing dependencies:

* Show each dependency as its `Task ID` followed by the current **status in parentheses**.
* Separate multiple dependencies with commas.
* If there are no dependencies, write `None`.

## 4. Consistency Checks

Before saving a task file, verify:

* All required properties are present and correctly ordered.
* Status values are lowercase and match the allowed set.
* Dependency statuses reflect the most recent information.
